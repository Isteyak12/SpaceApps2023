# SpaceApps 2023 Challenge

<b>What's Up With This Water?</b>
<br>
Have you ever been swimming in a natural body of water and felt curious about the microscopic and larger life all around you, or what else is living in the water? There is a vast amount of life in oceans, rivers, and lakesâ€”most of which cannot be seen with our eyes! Your challenge is to create an app that notifies people of endangered species in the bodies of water around them, explains what they can do to help preserve those species, and informs them how to use the water for recreation in a respectful way.

<b>OBJECTIVES
<br>
Your challenge is to create an app that allows users to check the water quality of their waterways and to learn what endangered species are living in the water as well as how to protect them. Think about how to make your app easy to use; it could be similar to a weather app but even more simplistic. Can your app help users to learn where the water has been before they swim in it? For example, someone swimming in North Carolina could learn that their water mass originated further south and was carried to them by the Gulf Stream.
